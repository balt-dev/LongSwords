# Long Swords

Basically all this does is makes swords really, really long. Nothing else to it.
(This works with other resource packs as long as the shape of the sword is kept the same.)

## Generator
If you want to make a sword that's larger (or smaller), you can [download the entire repository](https://github.com/balt-is-you-and-shift/LongSwords/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), edit the `/generator/longsword-gen.py` file, and then run it. It'll generate the sword as the specified amount of pixels long, plus the handle and tip.
